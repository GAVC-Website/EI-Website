# EI-Website
Our website, good description I know.
This thing breaks 90% of the time.
Just don't look too deep into it.
Useless code is intentional.
Inactive isn't a class; I just made it one.
Who put me in charge of the readme file?
I don't know how to create legal documents of important disclaimers.
The author should not be given this much power.-Noah
